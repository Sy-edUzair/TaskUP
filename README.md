# TaskUP
This is a Data Structures Project using C++ language.It predominantly uses concepts of priority queue using heap and arrays.The idea was taken through CPU scheduling and how tasks are prioritized on a lower level.The idea was to apply the same concept for us to make daily tasks easier to perform for us humans.Hope you enjoy it!
